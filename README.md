# EpidemicDynamicsWithaCostLimit
This repo contains data and codes to reproduce figures showed in "Epidemic dynamics with a cost limit regarding social distancing on multiplex networks" by W. Li and J. Zhou.

Note: Figure 3 is generated by run.m file in Fig3\Comparison folder using data from Fig3\Stochastic_simulation and Fig3\Numerical_simulation folders. Figures 4 and 5 are generated by run.m files in Figs4-7\T_initial=0\Comparison and Figs4-7\T_initial=0\L=infinity\Time_Vs_alpha, respectively. Figures 6 and 7 are generated by run.m and run2.m files in Figs4-7\T_initial=max+1\Comparison folder, respectively. The Networks folder includes data of networks used in simulations.
